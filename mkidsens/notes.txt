My big conclusions from the meeting:
- Are we sure there's no amorphous dielectric in the capacitor?
- Are we sure there's no amorphous dielectric in the Nb/Al contact?


Fab processing questions:
- how was oxide deposited / etched?
- how do we know nitride was etched all the way through?
- how do we know oxide was completely removed from capacitor?
- can we use ellipsometry to confirm there is no dielectric on top of the
capacitor?

- Do we have series capacitors in the Nb-Al junctions?
- Might be of order our tank capacitors, in which case they will introduce
large dissipation/TLS from aluminum oxide.  But, means inductance would have to be way off.  So
measure normal state resistance of inductors.

Can we see tunnel junctions in the capacitors?

Nb gap 1.5mV
Al gap 0.2mV
tunneling turn on voltage ~ 1.7mV sum of voltages
AC stimulus using the bridge of at many currents.  Low current:  Should see
zero voltage.  High currents:  exceed critical current of junction, tunneling
voltage appears.  VMIX OVL due to tunneling maybe?

- unreleased bolometer sees cosmic rays from entire chip.  released bolometers
are isolated from chip temperature, so don't see short pulses on chip
temperature.

Jonas unconcerned with different QTLS0 of frequency shift vs. Q
fits.  Far away extrapolation.  Clear we have large TLS on island.

slow chirped vs. fast chirped
fast chirp:  chirp is much faster than resonator ring down time, at extremely
high power.  1 Watt(!) level amplifiers.
fast chirp lets you put signal in you readout amplifier all the time
fast chirp lets you use the dynamic range of your ADC more effectively
white noise uses readout amplifier well, but ADC poorly.

Ringing in slow chirp network analysis:  resonator frequency shift decaying
exponentially after chirp crosses it.  Beating with input signal?  Ratio?
